Everywhere people are getting affected with COVID and I'm really worried about her. Please have a seat and tell me what happened. Last week my daughter came back from California as her college was closed on account of COVID. From the second day she has had high fever and has been coughing badly. I think that she has contracted the virus on her way home. Okay I understand your concern. Having a fever and cough doesn't necessarily mean someone has contracted the virus. These are symptoms common cold too. The change in the temperature of the atmosphere could have triggered these symptoms. Still to put your worries to rest I'm prescribing some medicines and an RTPCR test to the test by tomorrow and if the test results are positive make sure she is isolated. Another hand if the results are negative just give her that medicine and ask her to drink a lot of water. Also bring her in so I could examine her. Okay doctor I will bring her in the evening. Thank you. Welcome.",
